### Offering a job in the UTCS group? Look at these guidelines before you post. 

*This is to save you from trolls and get a good response from the community, as we deal with this all the time.*

**1 - Information about the company/idea**
* IP is obviously important, but please don't be overly secretive about your product. No one's looking to steal your idea.
* Information is valuable. We're not code monkeys, meaning we don't work on just anything. It has to interest us.
* Where does your company currently stand? Do you have anything done?
* General road map of what you plan to do, and where you plan to take the company.
* Using an NDA as an excuse to not give any information on what the job entails is a quick way to anger the group.
* What do *you* bring to the table?
  * *Offerings backed by marketing research, confirmation that there is a market, significant mockup work, etc. are more likely to enjoy a positive response.*

**2 - Payment**
* Equity, hourly, weekly, monthly, contract, it needs to be *something*.
* Not mentioning payment or expecting unpaid work without a very compelling reason usually implies you don't know what you're asking.
* Developers are paid well, and for good reason. Be aware of this, and be aware that *we* are aware of this.

**3 - Requirements**
* You *have* to understand what you're asking for. We can tell if you don't, and it reflects poorly on you.
* What languages/experience should the person have? I don't just mean "iOS/Android/Web", be specific. If you don't know this, then you need to research more first.

**4 - Honesty**
* Don't beat around the bush.
* If you're genuinely not sure you understand what you're asking for, by all means *say that* and ask the group for feedback on what you should expect.
* Be genuine, we don't like marketers.

**5 - Realism**
* While enthusiasm and ambition are appreciated, please ensure it's not at the expense of product vaibility.
* One person is often not enough.
* It will not get done in a month.
* Apps/websites are not "one-time" things where you can have it made and it's good for life. There will be bugs, there will be updates, new OS firmwares, new features, enhancements, etc.

**6 - DON'T**
* The following are some common examples of clich√© posts we get, please try to avoid sounding like them.
  * I need a website (and don't know what that means)!
  * I have an idea, someone build it for me (because I refuse to learn how)!
  * Need someone (don't really care) to make an (nonspecific) app for my (shitty/boring) company.
* Buzzwords. Everyone hates them, and it just tells us that you're filling space because you have no idea what you're talking about
* Pandering.

**7 - Familiarity with a good number of the following terms. They might not all be relevant to your idea, but understanding them/what they're for would establish a good baseline.**
*Specifically, the reason they're important to know is because chances are any interested developer is going to ask you questions regarding them.*
* Java
* Objective-C
* Python
* Backend
* Frontend
* Github
* Git
* Web framework
* What language(s) Android uses
* What language(s) iOS uses
* What language(s) web dev uses
* What `DB` stands for
* Library
* GPL

### I know this seems like a lot, but it's really nothing more than what we would expect to see in a professional job offering.
